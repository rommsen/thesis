@article{Attwell2007,
abstract = {This paper explores some of the ideas behind the Personal Learning Environment and considers why PLEs might be useful or indeed central to learning in the future. This is not so much a technical question as an educational one, although changing technologies are key drivers in educational change. The paper starts by looking at the changing face of education and goes on to consider the different ways in which the so-called net generation is using technology for learning. It goes on to consider some of the pressures for change in the present education systems. The idea of a Personal Learning Environment recognises that learning is ongoing and seeks to provide tools to support that learning. It also recognises the role of the individual in organising his or her own learning. Moreover, the pressures for a PLE are based on the idea that learning will take place in different contexts and situations and will not be provided by a single learning provider. Linked to this is an increasing recognition of the importance of informal learning. The paper also looks at changing technology, especially the emergence of ubiquitous computing and the development of social software. The paper believes that we are coming to realise that we cannot simply reproduce previous forms of learning, the classroom or the university, embodied in software. Instead, we have to look at the new opportunities for learning afforded by emerging technologies. Social software offers the opportunity to narrow the divide between producers and consumers. Consumers themselves become producers, through creating and sharing. One implication is the potential for a new ecology of open content, books, learning materials and multimedia, through learners themselves becoming producers of learning materials. Social software has already led to the widespread adoption of portfolios for learners, bringing together learning from different contexts and sources of learning and providing an ongoing record of lifelong learning, capable of expression in different forms. The paper considers how Personal Learning Environments might be developed through the aggregation of different services. The final section provides examples of practices that show how PLEs may be used in the future.},

abstract = {The influence of digital technologies as well as the World Wide Web on education rises dramatically. In former years Learning Management Systems (LMS) were introduced on educational institutes to address the needs both their institutions and their lecturers. Nowadays a shift from an institution-centered approach to a learner-centered one becomes necessary to allow individuality through the learning process and to think about learning strategies in general. In this paper a first approach of a Personal Learning Environment (PLE) is described. The technological concept is pointed out as well as a study about the graphical user-interface done at Graz University of Technology (TU Graz). It can be concluded that PLEs are the next generation environments, which help to improve the learning and teaching behavior.},

@article{Wild2008a,
abstract = {Institutions for formal education and most work places are equipped today with at least some kind of tool s that bring together peopl e and content artefacts in learning actviei tis to support them in constructing and processing information and knowledge. For almost half a century, science and practice have been discussing models on how to bring personalisation through digital means to these environments. Learning environments and their construction as well as maintenance makes up the most crucial part of the learning process and the desired learning outcomes and theories should take this into account. Instruction itself as the predominant paradigm has to step down. The learning environment is an (if not the) important outcome of a learning process, not just a stage to perform a learning play. For these good reasons, we therefore consider instructional design theories to be flawed. In this article we first clarify key concepts and assumptions for personalised learning environments. Afterwards, we summarise our critique on the contemporary models for personalised adaptive learning. Subsequently, we propose our alternative, i.e. the concept of a mash-up personal learning environment that provides adaptation mechanisms for learning environment construction and maintenance. The web application mash-up solution allows learners to reuse existing (web-based) tools plus services. Our alternative, LISL is a design language model for creating, managing, maintaining, and learning about learning environment design; it is complemented by a proof of concept, the MUPPLE platform. We demonstrate this approach with a prototypical implementation and a we think comprehensible example. Finally, we round up the article with a discussion on possible extensions of this new model and open problems.},

abstract = {The common understanding of e-learning has shifted over the last decade from the traditional learning objects portals to learning paradigms that enforces constructivism, discovery learning and social collaboration. Such type of learning takes place outside the formal academic settings (e.g., seminars or lectures) where a learning environment is created by using some kind of web application mashup tools. The use of these mashup tools moves the learning environment further away from being a monolithic platform towards providing an open set of learning tools, an unrestricted number of actors, and an open corpus of artifacts, either pre-existing or created by the learning process freely combinable and utilizable by learners within their learning activities. However, collaboration, mashup and contextualization can only be supported through services, which can be created and modified dynamically based on middlewares to suit the current needs and situations of learners. This article identifies middlewares suitable for creating effective personal learning environment based on Web 2.0 mashup tools. This article also proposed a general framework for constructing such personal learning environments based on Ambient Learning realized by learning agents and the use of Enterprise Mashup servers.},

@article{Schaffert2008a,
abstract = {The practice of learning and teaching is not pre-determined, but always related to the tools and systems used in the process. The development and rising success of social software applications such as weblogs and wikis and so-called Personal Learning Environments (PLE) changes, enables and challenges learning with the Internet. PLE, especially in contrast to traditional Learning Management Systems (LMS), received significant attention and are about changing the paradigm of learning and teaching. This paper tries to underpin a better understanding of the underlying concepts of both approaches and, on the other hand, to emphasise the consequences and challenges of PLE and its rising usage for learning. We have identified seven aspects where these changes are most obvious and/or important. To sum up, learning with PLE leads to changes concerning: (1) the role of the learner as active, self-directed creators of content; (2) personalisation with the support and data of community members; (3) learning content as an infinite bazaar; (4) the big role of social involvement; (5) the ownership of learner's data; (6) the meaning of self-organised learning for the culture of educational institutions and organisations, and (7) technological aspects of using social software tools and aggregation of multiple sources. The vast number of tools, supporting collaboration on the web is an indicator that PLE and social software tools are not only a flash in the pan, but lead to a new notion of learning and a measure for sustainable competence development. Nevertheless, the existing approaches and ideas for PLE need further development and elaboration. With the discussion of the related shifts from LMS towards PLE and their challenges, this paper may serve as the basis for learners, teachers and educational institutions decisions for (or against) the technological concept of PLE, on a general level and taking into account its pedagogical implications.},

abstract = {En este art\'{\i}culo se presenta una investigaci\'{o}n exploratoria basada en la etnograf\'{\i}a virtual desde un entorno de investigaci\'{o}n y aprendizaje con nuevas tecnolog\'{\i}as. La etnograf\'{\i}a es un m\'{e}todo de investigaci\'{o}n cualitativo de las ciencias sociales que es usado principalmente en la antropolog\'{\i}a socio-cultural, donde tiene su fundamento te\'{o}rico. El objetivo fue explorar la web 2.0 y sus herramientas desde la etnograf\'{\i}a virtual. El m\'{e}todo de investigaci\'{o}n es basado en la etnograf\'{\i}a virtual y la observaci\'{o}n participante, la cual se realiz\'{o} participando en comunidades virtuales y por medio de un blog y otras herramientas 2.0. El resultado de la experiencia etnogr\'{a}fica es un modelo descriptivo de la web 2.0 basado en un Entorno Personal de Aprendizaje (PLE).},

abstract = {This article presents an exploratory research based on the virtual ethnography from an environment of research and learning including new technologies. The ethnography is a method of qualitative research of social sciences that is mainly used in the socio-cultural Anthropology, where it has its theoretical basis. The target was to explore the web 2.0 and its tools. The process of participant observation is by means of a blog, other tools and virtual communities. The result is a descriptive model of the web 2.0 based on a Personal !earning Environment which developed in the ethnographic experience.},

annote = {Definition
Mashup indicates a way to create new (web) applications by combining existing data and services from several sources
        
Mashup by aggregation - assemble sets of info from different sources within single interface
        
Mashup by integration - complex applications that inegrate different application programming interfaces (APIs) to combine data from different sources
        
Pedagogy
PLE - self-defined collection of services, tools and devices that help learners build Personal Knowledge Networks (PKN), encompassing taxit knowledge (people) and explicit knowledge (information) 
        
Rationale
Mashup PLE - let learners create their own learning mashups that leverage components and content generated by learning service providers and other learners around the Web
        
Challenge
Model-driven mashup development (MDMD) approach to deal with scalability, interoperability, reuse and automatic service invocation and mediation within mashup PLE
        
Skill
PLE framework - PLEF-Ext - enables user-friendly creation, management, sharing and reuse of learning mashups
Share, find, integrate, reuse, remix learning services based on MDMD approach
        
Citeable notes
The concept of mashup is used to develop PLE to allow learners easy navigation to choose their learning contents by creating learning mashups.
